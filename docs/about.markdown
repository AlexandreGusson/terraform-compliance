`terraform-compliance` is a test framework written against terraform to enable negative testing capabilty against a terraform plan before you deploy the infrastructure.

## Quick Overview
- __compliance:__ Ensure the implemented code is following security standards, your own custom standards
- __behaviour driven development:__ We have BDD for nearly everything, why not for IaC ?
- __portable:__ just install it from `pip` or run it via `docker`
- __why ?:__ why not ?
